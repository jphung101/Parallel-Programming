# Welcome!

This repo is my attempt to **dive deeper into parallel computing** and to serve as **personal documentation** for myself (corresponding Notion page is pending!). I will be covering (in order) `OpenCL`, `CUDA`, and `Metal` on **macOS** and **Windows**.

# OpenCL

At this point, I am getting a simple `OpenCL` progam to run on *macOS with an M-Series chip*, trying to understand everything from:

- All that is needed to properly **compile** (`Makefile`, dependencies, etc)
- Best ways to **allocate memory** (espeicially for `tiling`)
- Good practices for **memory access** (bursting/banking)

As for more complicated programs, I plan to update my [Ray Tracer](https://github.com/jphung101/Ray-Tracer) to support `OpenCL`

# OpenMP

Figured while I am busy to try something "simplier" like `OpenMP`. Might regret this...

# CUDA

WIP

# Metal

*Heavy* WIP
